This modifier is designed for use with Smarty v3
If you are familiar with Smarty templating engine this will be fairly 
easy for you to use.

Simply drop the modifier into your Smarty plugins directory.

=====================================================================

Useage: 

simple                {$dTimestamp|ago}  
or specifiying a unit {dTimestamp|ago:'week'}

The possible units accepted are singular forms, one of 
'minute','hour','day','week','month','year'

If no unit is secified, the plugin will work out the 'best' unit based 
on the length of time that has passed since that timestamp.

EXAMPLE
=====================================================================
From within your *.tpl template file you can do something like this

  <h2>{$sArticleTitle|esape}</h2>
  Posted: {$sArticleTimestamp|ago:'day'}

Which might show

  My Article Title
  Posted: 6 days ago
